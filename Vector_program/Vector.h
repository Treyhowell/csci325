 *    Default constructor.  Initializes an empty vector.

 *    Copy constructor.  Initializes a dynamic array of the appropriate

 *
 * Parameters:
 *    other - a constant reference to the vector that is to be copied.
 *
 * Post-conditions:
 *    vec_ptr is initialized, and its array contains other.vec_ptr's data,
 *    vec_size=other.vec_size, and vec_capacity=other.vec_capacity.

 *    Assignment operator.  Initializes a dynamic array of the appropriate

 *    other - a constant reference to the vector that is to be copied.

/* Description:
 *    Similar to std::vector.push_back(int element), stores element at the end of the vector.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    element - The item to be inserted at the back of the vector.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 *    Item element has is stored at the end of the vector.
 *
 * Notes:
 *    If necessary, calls resize() before adding element to the end of the vector.
 *    This reserve doubles the current capacity of the vector.

 *    Requests that the vector capacity be doubled (the capacity will become 1 after resizing if it is 0 before resizing).
 *
 *    This function has no effect on vector size and cannot alter its elements.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 *    Vector capacity is now doubled.  Vector size (and contents) remains the same.
